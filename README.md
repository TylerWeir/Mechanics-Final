# Mechanics-Final
Computational project for my Analytical Mechanics course. I used Lagrangian Mechanics to derirve the equations of motion for a pendulum whose base accelerates along a fixed path.  Then I used an Euler integration routine to integrate the equations of motion for two different paths: a flat path and a square path.  I showcased the resulting motion using matplotlib animations.  At each frame in the animation I translate the whole system so that the base of the pendulum is centered at the origin.
